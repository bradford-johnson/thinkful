## **❓ Business Objective** 
> ### *Lariat’s* **business objective**: `minimize their costs` and `maximize their revenue`  
> This was my **first Thinkful Capstone project**, and I was playing the role of a data analyst consultant for [*Lariat*](https://fictionalcompanies.fandom.com/wiki/Lariat_Rent-A-Car). *Lariat* is a fictious car rental company which has a fleet of **4,000 rental cars**, **72 different car makes** and **878 unique car models** ranging from the years 2016-2018.  
>
> *Lariat* also wanted me to **develop two deliverables** for them, the first being an **Excel model** which contains dynamic and static charts, and a model which allows users to manipulate business parameters and see the results of those changes. The second deliverable was a **PowerPoint** which shows the data analysis process, and shares insights with *Lariat* executives. Finally, I **presented** my slides and model to a Thinkful official who was playing the role of a *Lariat* executive.
## **📊 The Data**
> *Lariat* provided me with 4 Excel Workbooks, each of the Workbooks contained **different** data:
> - Workbook 1 - **Fleet vehicle data:** `Car ID, Make, Model, Year...`
> - Workbook 2 - **Cost data:** `Car ID, Monthly cost, Insurance Costs...` 
> - Workbook 3 - **Transaction data:** `Car ID, Revenue, Branch ID, Dates...`
> - Workbook 4 - **Branch data:** `Branch ID, State, City, Airport?...`
> 
> The Workbooks and columns are set up like a **SQL database**, with relational data tables, and keys that connect the different tables. The structure of the data is important to understand as this will tell you what formulas can be used to combine the data, and how to **interpret** each “table”. 
> 
> After consolidating the Workbooks, I cleaned up the data and began to explore it with **pivot charts** and **tables**. I also began combining the data using formulas to make this data tell its story. 
> 
> The **most common** formulas I used include: `=VLOOKUP()`, `=XLOOKUP()`, `=SUMIF()`, and `=IF()`.

## **📐 Methods**
> The first thing I wanted to get from combining the data was the **revenue**, **costs**, and **profit** for all of the 4,000 fleet rental cars by the **month**, and then for the **year**.  
> 
> The data was **missing records** for December and most of November, so I had to do without, however with the cell references I used, this is not a problem as post analysis additional data can be added and the Workbook, all the formulas, and the model would update and be accurate. 
> Once I had built out my formulas, I explored my data further with `pivot tables` and `charts`.  This let me see trends in the **profitability of different car makes and models**. I explored potential trends such as by branch, however with the variability of the locations and markets it would need more data before any trend of significance is noticed.
